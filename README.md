# Manga Pages
üìñ Easily find the place to read a manga or light novel

As of the latest update, support for manhwa and manhua has been added. You can choose between manga, light novels, manhwa or manhua from the dropdown on the main page.

## About
I built Manga Pages to solve the issue of finding which legal service provides a manga/light novel. Search engines don't always show this information (and often show lots of ad-filled unofficial sites). The site provides a simple hub to finding what you want to read next showing which sites have the manga/light novel available and a MyAnimeList button to read information about it. Think of this service as like [because.moe](https://because.moe) but for manga/light novels. The source code for the backend can be found 
[here](https://github.com/davidcralph/mangapages-backend).

üîç Fast search with support for [multiple websites](#supported-websites)
