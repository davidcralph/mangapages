# Manga Pages
üìñ Easily find the place to read a manga

## About
I built Manga Pages to solve the issue of finding which legal service provides a manga. Search engines don't always show this information (and often show lots of ad-filled unofficial sites). The site provides a simple hub to finding what you want to read next showing which sites have the manga available and a MyAnimeList button to read information about it. Think of this service as like [because.moe](https://because.moe) but for manga.

## Features
üîç Fast search with support for [multiple websites](#supported-websites)

üåô Clean UI with light and dark theme

üìà Database updated frequently to always show the latest manga

* Support for more than just manga

## Notice
The backend is currently not opensource and most likely won't be for some time (it's a bit of a mess!). If you wish to make your own backend, all you really need is a ``/random`` and ``/search`` route that returns an array like this:
```js
[
  {
    "title": "Hunter x Hunter",
    "site": "viz",
    "url": "https://www.viz.com/hunter-x-hunter" // depending on the site, this may be different and you will need custom code!
  }
]
```
